<hr />

<p class="indent">Sir: I am an Indian who has, by the fear of
your Government in India been forced to seek
refuge in the United States, at least for the
period of the war. In 1907, when Lord Minto&#39;s
Government decided to put into operation an
obsolete Regulation of the East India Company
(III of 1818) against me, in order to put me
out of the way, for a while, without even the
form of a trial, Lord Morley, the then Secretary
of State for India, defending his action, gave
me the highest testimonial as far as my private
character was concerned. You must have heard
that speech though it would be presumptuous to
imagine that you remember it.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8"></a>[pg&nbsp;8]</span>
MY CREDENTIALS</p>

<p class="indent">Even my worst enemies have not been able to
point out anything in my life which would give
any one even the shadow of a reason to say that,
in my private life, I have not been as good and
honorable a person as any British politician or
diplomat or proconsul, is or has been or can be.
My record as a wage-earner is as clean and as
honorable as that of the best of Britishers engaged
in governing India.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. H. W. Nevinson, than whom a more truthful
and honorable publicist is not known in
British life, has said in his work, &quot;The New
Spirit in India,&quot; that once when he told a high
Anglo-Indian official that I was a good man
held in great esteem by my countrymen, the
latter remarked, that because I had a high character
in private life, I was the more dangerous
as an agitator.</p>

<p class="indent">I am reciting all this as evidence of my
credentials to speak on behalf of my countrymen.
Just now I am a mere exile. For the
present, I cannot think of returning to India,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>[pg&nbsp;9]</span>
unless in course of time I begin to feel that by
running the risk of being hanged or imprisoned,
I should be doing a greater service to my country,
than by remaining outside. I am now in
the fifty-third year of my life, out of which
more than thirty-four were spent in the limelight
of public gaze. I am a man of family
with children and grandchildren and have had
my share, however small, of the good things of
the world. Political freedom for India has been
a passion to me ever since I was a boy. However
hard the life of an exile or a convict may be,
I am prepared to risk everything in the cause
of my country.</p>

<p class="indent">In the language of that prince of political
exiles, Joseph Mazzini, the word &quot;exile,&quot; is perhaps
the most cursed in the dictionary of man.
It dries up the springs of affection; it deprives
its victims of the sweet babblings and lispings
of his little ones with whom every man of age
loves to beguile the evening of his days; it
closes the avenues of all comfort that are associated
with that sweet word home; it shuts the
doors of heaven and makes life a continued
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>[pg&nbsp;10]</span>
agony, hanging on the slender thread of such
pity and hospitality as one may receive from
the generous and kind-hearted foreigner.</p>

<p class="center">INDIA COMPARED WITH GREAT BRITAIN</p>

<p class="indent">How can I ask you who have perhaps never
left your country except for some pleasant trips
on the Continent, to put yourself in my position,
if possible, for a moment only, and imagine how
I long to kiss the soil, with which are mixed the
bones of my mother and other forbears; how I
miss the loving embrace of my beloved father,
the sweet, expectant, imploring eyes of my
widowed daughter, the devoted look of my wife
and the kindly affectionate hand-shake of good
and devoted friends. Nor can you realize how
an Indian loves his country. How can you, of
dark, sombre, fog ridden and misty climes, who
are born of a chill atmosphere, of treacherously
changing weather, who count hours of sunshine
and months of darkness and fog and rain and
snow and sleet, enter into the feelings of one
whose country is a perpetual sunshine, and where
universal light reigns&mdash;a country where weather
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>[pg&nbsp;11]</span>
is neither treacherous nor continually and rapidly
changing, where beautiful dawns, starry nights,
moonlit fields, resplendent waters, snow-clad hills
and joyous rivers constantly and unremittingly
fill one&#39;s mind with the sublimity, grandeur and
beauty of nature; where one needs no stimulants
to make him feel lighter and happier. An
Indian needs no alcohol to forget his troubles.
He has only to go to the Himalaya, or to the
banks of Ganga, Brahmputra, Sindh or their
numerous tributaries by which the land is blessed
and fertilized. Oh, no! It is impossible for you
to understand how passionately an Indian loves
his country. He would rather starve in India
than be a ruler of men in a foreign climate. For
him, India is the land of Gods&mdash;the <i>Deva Bhúmí</i>
of his forefathers. It is the land of knowledge,
of faith, of beatitude&mdash;the <i>Gnan Bhúmí</i>, the
<i>Dharma Bhúmí</i> and the <i>Punni-Bhúmí</i> of the
ancient Aryas. It is the land of the Vedas and
of the heroes&mdash;the <i>Veda Bhúmí</i> and the <i>Vir
Bhúmí</i> of his ancestors. Yes, to him, it is the
land of lands, the only place where he wishes to
live, and more so, where he wishes to die. For
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>[pg&nbsp;12]</span>
a Hindu to die anywhere but in India, is as if
he had been damned to hell. He shudders at
the idea. To him, it is unthinkable. You may
call it foolish, unpractical, sentimental and unprogressive;
but there it is&mdash;a mighty fact of
life into which no foreigner can penetrate.</p>

<p class="indent">Every Englishman loves his country, its darkness,
its fog, its sleet and rain nothwithstanding.
Who does not love his country and who does not
say:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Home, kindred, friends and country&mdash;these</span>
<span class="i2">Are ties with which we never part;</span>
<span class="i0">From clime to clime, o&#39;er land and seas,</span>
<span class="i2">We bear them in our heart;</span>
<span class="i0">But, oh! &#39;tis hard to feel resigned,</span>
<span class="i0">When they must all be left behind!</span>
</div>
</div>
<p class="center">&mdash;<span class="smcap">J. Montgomery</span>.</p>

<p class="indent">If then, an Indian decides to be an exile, voluntarily
and maybe for life, he only does so
either under a grave sense of duty or of danger.
The duty lies in speaking <i>the truth</i> about political
conditions in India and the danger in being
effectively prevented from doing so if he remains
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>[pg&nbsp;13]</span>
there. No Indian can speak the <i>whole truth</i>
while in India. The criminal laws of your Government&mdash;your
Penal and Criminal Codes,
Seditious Meetings and Conspiracy Acts, and
Press Laws, your tribunals presided over by
your own people unaided by jurors&mdash;effectively
gag his mouth.</p>

<p class="indent">All honor to those who, though they cannot
speak the whole truth, yet keep the fire burning
in India and do as much as considerations of
policy and expediency permit. If they do not
speak the <i>whole truth</i>, they have at least the
consolation of being at home, in the heart of
their family and surrounded by their dear ones.
For a political exile, however, there is nothing
else to do, unless he has to carry on a fight for
his living also, in which case he will divide his
time between the two, that of earning bread and
crying for justice for his country. Happily I
have been comparatively free from much anxiety
about the first. The only justification for my
condition of exile, then, is that I continue to
speak the truth about conditions in India and
draw the attention of the world to them.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>[pg&nbsp;14]</span>
But an additional reason has just been furnished
to me by the morning papers of March 15,
1917. It is said that your agents in India have
decided to raise a war loan of $500,000,000,
equivalent to 1,500,000,000 Rupees of Indian
money, and also, to make the floating of the loan
easy, your Government has agreed to increase the
duty on cotton imports by 4% <i>ad valorem</i>. This
war loan, it is added, would be a &quot;<i>free gift</i>&quot; of
India to Great Britain! A free gift of $500,000,000
by starving, poverty-stricken India, to
rich, wealthy, mighty Great Britain! Could anything
be more astounding, more absurd and more
tyrannical. The news has stunned me. I know
that David Lloyd George, the British war-lord
of 1917, is not the same person who was the
radical Chancellor of Exchequer in the Liberal
Government from 1908 to 1914, and who did
magnificent service to the British workingman
by reducing his burdens and alleviating his condition.
I have been told that the said David
Lloyd George is dead and you, sir, are an entirely
different person. The Lloyd George of 1914
could not possibly have done the thing which you,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>[pg&nbsp;15]</span>
sir, in alliance with Curzons and Milners have
just accomplished. The newspapers say you are
the same person; only you have changed. If so,
the change is not of opinion but of personality.
Evidently the soul of the original David Lloyd
George has left the body to make room for an
altogether different soul. We Indians believe
in the possibility of such a metamorphosis taking
place even in the lifetime of the same body!
The best part of the joke, however, in connection
with the £100,000,000 transaction lies in the fact
that you call it <i>a gift by India</i>&mdash;<i>a gift indeed</i>.
A gift like those given by Belgium to Germany.
Is it not so, Mr. George? You are a shrewd
person, very well educated, clever in diplomacy,
well versed in tricks of speech and a master in
statecraft; but even you ought to know that this
trick will not deceive any one&mdash;not even the
Indians who have been so often deceived by
your predecessors in business. By way of adding
insult to injury, you profess to do &quot;<i>an act of justice</i>&quot;
to India by consenting to an increase of 4%
on the duty leviable on imports of cotton goods.
You say it is necessary for the success of the war
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>[pg&nbsp;16]</span>
loan of $500,000,000; but do you think that the
Indians are so devoid of knowledge of the ordinary
rules of arithmetic as not to understand
what this &quot;hitting below the belt&quot; means to them?
Your additional duty would but bring only
$5,000,000 or $6,000,000 to the Indian exchequer,
if the imports of cotton do not undergo
a decrease. Your Government in India estimates
it at £1,000,000 sterling. The interest at
5-1/2% amounts to $27,500,000. Your Government
in India estimates an annual charge of £6,000,000
sterling. Where is the balance to come
from except from the famished Indian <i>ryot</i>? Is
that how you show your love for democracy, for
the people at large, for the workingman? Your
representatives in India and outside, are proclaiming
to the world that India is the most
lightly taxed country in the world, withholding
the fact that the average income of an Indian is
only £2 a year, of which he pays 7 shillings
toward taxes. That was before the new taxes
were imposed.</p>

<p class="indent">Your publicists circulate another lie, viz., that
India pays no tribute, while they know that from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>[pg&nbsp;17]</span>
20 to 40 millions sterling are remitted to England
every year, out of which only a portion
represents interest on loans made to India for
the building of railways which your countrymen
have used in developing their trade, and the remainder
is the profit you make out of India.
Then you cite the figures of trade in support of
your theory that India is prosperous under
British rule, but you forget that that trade benefits
your country more than it benefits India, if
at all. We send you food and raw materials at
cheapest prices, making ourselves liable to
&quot;famines.&quot; You pay us in articles of luxury,
of flimsy value, at the highest prices. The
balance of trade is always in your favor. We
toil and sweat, and your countrymen enjoy the
profit. All the paying industries, railways, tea,
jute, half of the cotton industry, etc., are in the
hands of your countrymen. Theirs are the insurance
companies, banks, railways and ships
that profit by their trade. The railway rates
discriminate against native industries and internal
trade. Your countrymen get the plum-pudding,
while our people cannot have even two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>[pg&nbsp;18]</span>
meals of the coarsest food every day. When
there is famine, millions die. Of late, your
&quot;scientific&quot; methods of famine relief have succeeded
in controlling mortality figures in famine
days. The method by which you do this is
genuinely scientific. Most of the deaths are
charged to epidemics and disease; no one notices,
however, that the havoc caused by disease is due
to lack of nourishment and consequent low
vitality. God-fearing Englishmen have cried
themselves hoarse over the situation. The misery
of the Indian masses has been pictured by their
powerful pens in pathetic and soul-stirring words,
but you and your colleagues still continue to
ignore what they have said. New methods are
every day being invented to exploit us. New
departments with fat salaries for Englishmen are
being multiplied. The public debt is being piled
up. While hundreds of millions are spent on
railways, nothing has been done to develop local
industries. The country is suffering from lack
of capital (cash and credit). (See Sir D. M.
Hamilton&#39;s article in the <i>Calcutta Review</i> for
July, 1916.) Every honest inquirer who makes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>[pg&nbsp;19]</span>
inquiries on the spot and does not depend on
the reports of your officials, finds and reports
that the condition of the masses is the most pitiable
(see the article by Mr. Manohar Lal in the
<i>Allahabad Economic Journal</i> for April, 1916,
and also the paper by Mr. Patro, of Madras,
read in a meeting presided over by the Governor
of Madras). For the latest British testimony on
the point, see an article on Indian Industrial
Development by Mr. Moreland, C.S.I., C.I.E., in
the <i>Quarterly Review</i> for April, 1917, in the
course of which he remarks: &quot;It is a matter of
common knowledge that the standard of life in
India is undesirably low; that while the masses of
the people are provided with the bare necessities
of life of a bare existence [Are they?&mdash;L. R.]
they are in far too many cases badly housed and
badly clothed, badly doctored and badly taught,
often overworked and often underfed; and that
the present income, even if it were equitably distributed,
would not suffice to provide the population
with even the most indispensable elements
of a reasonable life.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A careful study of the Reports on Prices
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>[pg&nbsp;20]</span>
and Wages discloses that the real living wage in
the case of the vast bulk of agricultural laborers
has considerably diminished, and this in spite of
the absurd conclusion of the Prices Commission
appointed by your Government a few years ago.
No one knows better than you, Mr. David Lloyd
George, that big buildings in cities, mostly owned
by foreign capitalists exploiting the country; big
trade carried on by foreign exporters and importers;
railway mileage and receipts of Government
revenue do not mean prosperity. Even the
importation of treasure secured by capitalists in
payment for exports does not indicate better conditions
of the masses. If the masses are so
prosperous, as your officers say, why cannot you
tax the people for purposes of education and
sanitation? Why is the death rate so high (over
30 per thousand)? Why can&#39;t you force the
local bodies to spend money on education and
sanitation? Why do your finance ministers say
that there is no room for further taxes? Most
of your agents in India know the real condition
of the people but they have to conceal it from
the British public as well as the world, as that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>[pg&nbsp;21]</span>
enables them and their kin to continue in the
enjoyment of that power which means so much
to them.</p>

<p class="indent">In reply, you might well ask, why then is
India loyal? Why do the people put up with
all this? Why don&#39;t they rebel? Because they
have been emasculated, and emasculated so completely,
that they are absolutely helpless against
your organized brigandage. They are weak,
ignorant and incompetent. Sixty-four years ago
they were not so helpless. But now they are
completely demoralized and penniless. Your
system has ground them into dust. They cannot
even protect themselves from wild beasts. You
have completely disarmed them. No Indian can
possess a firearm except under a license from
your magistrates, which is only rarely granted.
You have completely hypnotized them by your
professions of disinterested liberalism and altruism.
The truth has, after all, dawned on them
that you are the worst harpies they ever have
had and if they could they would overthrow you
without a scruple. You know that you are safe
in their helplessness. When the war came they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>[pg&nbsp;22]</span>
deluded themselves with the hope that in your
hour of need you might accord them a better
treatment, but by this time they have found their
mistake and have concluded that, just as a lion
may die of sheer exhaustion when attacked by
an enemy rather than willingly loosen his grip
on his prey so long as there is breath in his body,
so a nation holding another in subjection might
endanger her own existence without loosening
her grip on her victim.</p>

<p class="indent">When the war broke out in August, 1914,
I, with other Indian publicists, thought that however
badly you had treated us in the past we had
nothing to gain by German victory and the best
thing, under the circumstances, was for us to
stand by you and establish our claim to better
treatment. The Princes and people of India
therefore stood by you. You and your colleagues
have been singing their praises and extolling their
loyalty, but nothing has been done so far to give
them even the elementary political rights of a
free people. Verily, we have had a deluge of
fine words but not an iota of deeds. On the
other hand, you have imposed fresh burdens on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>[pg&nbsp;23]</span>
us. While doing an &quot;act of justice&quot; about the
cotton duties you have committed a wrong which
wipes away the little good that might otherwise
have been expected to accrue therefrom. Your
courts and officers in India have taken away
what little freedom the people enjoyed before.
In cases of alleged sedition the sentences inflicted
have been quite on a par with the doings of the
Romanoffs in Russia. This time even women
have felt your steel.</p>

<p class="indent">You knew as well as anyone else does, how the
German government has been trying to win the
good will of the Indians. It cannot be denied
that the temptation was alluring. If, then, we
have withstood it, it was not because we were in
love with your Government in India, but on
different grounds. Personally, I do not believe
that any liberty is worth having which we cannot
win ourselves, because liberty won by the
aid of another places us at the mercy of that
other. European diplomacy is so crooked that
it is futile to place faith in the promises of any
of them.</p>

<p class="indent">I would esteem German friendship as much as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>[pg&nbsp;24]</span>
British or American or that of the Japanese or
the Chinese; I would gratefully accept any help
anybody would render in educating and fitting
our young men for the coming task, but I would
not do anything that would cause useless bloodshed
in India. I am not afraid of blood. Blood
will have to be shed if we are to gain our freedom.
I am not afraid of failures and defeats.
Failures and defeats are sometimes the necessary
steps to victory. I do not believe in peace at any
price; nor pacificism at any cost. I do not believe
that &quot;they also serve who only stand and wait.&quot;
I am for a manly assertion of our rights, even
though blood may have to be spilled in asserting
or defending them; yet I would consider it highly
improper to encourage bloodshed where there is
not a ghost of a chance of success. That, in my
eyes, is sheer lunacy and I have never made a
secret of it. So I protested against my people
attempting to stir up revolt in India, under the
instigation of a foreign government. It was due
to my horror of useless bloodshed. I have no
doubt that <i>agents provocateur</i> played an important
part in instigating those whom your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>[pg&nbsp;25]</span>
courts have found guilty and sent to the gallows.
I believe that the men who have been sacrificed
should have lived and worked for the movement
for which they have died. So that, in a nutshell,
gives you my attitude towards foreign help.
Remember, please, sir, that I do not presume to
pronounce any judgment on those who think
differently and have acted in the light of their
consciences. I simply state my opinion and my
attitude.</p>

<p class="indent">This time the movement has failed. It was
bound to fail. But the experience which the
Indians engaged in the cause have gained is not
lost. Next time, and who knows, the chance may
come at no distant date, they will profit by the
experience thus gained. The world is not in
love with you, sir. There are a dozen peoples
in the world who will be glad to see your downfall
and help in bringing it about. They will
not support the Indian Nationalist and the
Indian Revolutionist openly, but they will encourage
him in every way they can, without
bringing about diplomatic complications. So the
Indian will not be altogether friendless when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>[pg&nbsp;26]</span>
the next opportunity to strike comes. By that
time the country also will be better prepared to
do something more definite and more spectacular.</p>

<p class="indent">Under the circumstances, the question that I
wish to put to you is: &quot;Would you do nothing
to avert it?&quot; It is in your power to act if you
will. The Indians are very easily satisfied. They
abhor bloodshed. They do not like revolution.
They will gladly remain in the Empire, if permitted
to do so on terms of self-respect and honor.
Their needs are few. Their life is simple. They
care more for spiritual values than for worldly
goods. They envy nobody&#39;s property. They have
no ambition to start on a career of exploitation.
All they want is to be let to live and think as
they will. At present they are let <i>to exist</i>, but
not to live. More than 100 million are insufficiently
fed. At least 60 millions do not get
two meals a day. More than 80% of the boys
receive no schooling, and more than 90% of the
girls. They work and toil and sweat primarily
in the interests of the British capitalist and
secondarily in the interests of his Indian colleague.
The latter only gets the leavings of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>[pg&nbsp;27]</span>
former. The ships, the railways, the leading
banking houses, the big insurance offices, the tea
plantations, one-half of the cotton mills, about
all the woollen mills, most of the paper mills, all
jute mills are owned by the former; a few by
the latter. The profits of agriculture are divided
between your Government and the big landlords.
The pressure on land has reduced the size of the
ryots&#39; holdings, while the number of mouths
requiring food and the number of bodies requiring
clothing has increased.</p>

<p class="indent">Your Government encourages drinking, speculating
and gambling in a way never before
conceived. If you have any pity in your heart,
sir; if you are a good father and a good husband,
I would beseech you to devote but an hour&#39;s
time to the wages tables printed by your Government
in their Report on Prices and Wages
(1915). I give a few samples below:</p>

<p class="indent">In the district of Patna (Behar), the monthly
wage of an able-bodied agricultural laborer in
the year 1907 was only R5.62 (say R6) equal to
8s. or $2. In 1873 it was from R3 to R4. Imagine
the laborer having a family of four and then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28"></a>[pg&nbsp;28]</span>
conceive how he manages to live on this wage.
In Fyzabad (Oude) the monthly wage of an
able-bodied agricultural laborer was only R4
(5s. 4d. or $1.33) in 1905, the same as it was
in 1873. In 1906 it is given as ranging from
R1.87 to R4 a month. From 1873 to 1906 it
was never more than R4 a month.</p>

<p class="indent">In Cawnpore (U. P.) it was R3.75 in 1873;
R3 in 1892; less than 4 in 1896; from 3.44 to
R5 in 1898 and from R3.69 to 7 in 1903; at
which figure it practically stayed up to 1906,
the last year for which figures are given in the
report.</p>

<p class="indent">In Meerut (U. P.) it was R4.33 in 1906 as
against R4.5 in 1873.</p>

<p class="indent">In Belgaun (Madras) it was R6.25 in 1912.</p>

<p class="indent">In Jubbulpore (C. P.) it was R5 in 1908.</p>

<p class="indent">In Raipur (C. P.) it was R5 in 1908.</p>

<p class="indent">In Bellary (Madras) it was R4.75 in 1907.</p>

<p class="indent">In Salem (Madras) it has never exceeded
R3.67 since 1873.</p>

<p class="indent">The Government postal runners who carry
mails at a trotting pace for several miles a day,
often making two trips in 24 hours, are paid the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>[pg&nbsp;29]</span>
following salaries in the different provinces of
your Indian Empire:</p>

<p class="indent">Postmen who are supposed to be literate, received
from R10 to R16 a month (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, from
$3.33 to $5.33 a month) in the different provinces
in 1913.</p>

<p class="indent">The scale of wages allowed to unskilled labor
in the railway yards of Mirzapore and Cawnpore
(U. P.) is given between R5 to R6 per month
(<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, less than $2.00). These are figures of
1914.</p>

<p class="indent">In the canal foundry and workshop at Roorkee
(U. P.) the daily wage in 1916 was only 4
annas a day (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, 8 cents).</p>

<p class="indent">In the Cawnpore saddlery establishment, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>[pg&nbsp;30]</span>
bullock drivers, the sweepers and the <i>Bhishties</i>
received only R5 and R6 a month (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, less than
8s. or $2.00); the lascars from R6 to R7 (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>,
$2.00 to $2.33).</p>

<p class="indent">In the woolen mills in Northern India unskilled
labor was paid at R8.12 (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, less than
$3.00) a month in 1914. These are the rates
allowed in big cities. For other big cities the
rates may, in some cases, be somewhat better,
but in small rural towns and villages, they are
considerably less.</p>

<p class="indent">Does the Indian laborer, considering his standard
of life, the size of his family and the requirements
of decency, get a living wage? I am
sure that a humane inquirer, not so much interested
in the good name of the Government
as in truth, will have no hesitation in answering
the question in the negative. Any increase in
wages has to be divided over the average strength
of a family, which will show how disproportionate
the increase in wages is to the increase in
prices. In a family of five with one or two
earning hands the increase in wages is two-fold
at the most. While the increase in the cost of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>[pg&nbsp;31]</span>
living by the increase in prices is five-fold. Your
Official Report writers always ignore this important
consideration. As for the housing conditions
in which Indian workmen live, let me present to
you the following testimony from a recent issue
of the <i>Times of India</i>, Bombay (quoted in the
London <i>Times</i>, June, 1917):</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;It is no unusual sight to find fifteen or twenty
persons, of both sexes, lying huddled on the floor
of a single room in a stifling atmosphere and a
vile stench. A single small window or an open
door gives the only ventilation. Furniture there
is none, beyond a few brass pots and some pegs.
The sanitary arrangements are unspeakable.
Every noise and smell that occurs in the neighborhood
penetrates the crazy walls and floor and
disturbs the sleepers. The chawls are often so
rickety that it is a miracle that they do not collapse
under their own weight. They seem to
be kept up like a house of cards, by the support
of their scarcely less rickety neighbors.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">As for the Indian laborer getting any education
or any leisure for art or for the pursuit of
taste, that is out of the question. The condition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>[pg&nbsp;32]</span>
of the small farmer or <i>ryot</i> is even worse. Sir,
if you are ever inclined to study the actual conditions
of life in India, do not rely upon the
&quot;conclusions&quot; of your officers as embodied in
reports. Study the facts, given in the reports,
but disregard the conclusions. If you seek
the aid of an Indian Nationalist he may show
you how the reports are drawn up, and how
dates and figures have been selected to suit
conclusions. Having been a lawyer most of
your life you are well aware of the magical
properties of special pleading. In the hands of
a skillful apologist, the figures can be made to
mean anything. Better still, if you want to have
a glimpse of conditions of life in India, depute
an honest man of the type of Mr. Nevinson to
go to Indian villages unaccompanied by officials,
and see the things for himself; or to the slums
in towns. The slums of Calcutta, Bombay,
Madras, Lahore, Delhi, Cawnpore, Lucknow,
Benares, will throw the slums of London and
New York far back into the shade. The latter
are verily a paradise as compared with the former.
As to the villages, the less said the better.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>[pg&nbsp;33]</span>
The point is in fact conceded by all fair-minded
English publicists.</p>

<p class="indent">The <i>Manchester Guardian</i>, only the other day,
discussing the recent increase in the cotton
duties, questioned &quot;the wisdom and justice&quot; of
this £100,000,000 exaction from India and admitted
that &quot;the loss it represents to an extremely
poor population like that of India is very much
greater than the gain to England.&quot; Even the
<i>Morning Post</i>, that representative of Jingo Imperialism,
recognizes the extreme poverty of the
masses of India. I will not quote the <i>Nation</i> as
you do not like that journal. The moneyed
classes of India, the Rajas and Maharajas, the
bankers and mill owners, the industrial corporations
that will fill this loan could not find a more
profitable investment. They get 100 per cent.
stock for 95 and besides get from 5 to 5-1/2 per
cent. interest, in some cases free of income tax
for thirty years to come. Upon whom will the
burden of interest fall? Neither on the lender
nor on the borrower, but mainly on the ryot and
the laborer. Do you know, sir, that the average
price of salt (wholesale) in Lahore, Punjab, had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34"></a>[pg&nbsp;34]</span>
risen from R1-9-7 a maund in 1912-13 to R2-7-3
in 1916-17? But that in retail sale &quot;the average
price of salt per maund (82 lbs.) had risen from
R1-14-0 to R5-0-0&quot; (<i>Tribune</i>, Lahore, March,
1917). The fresh taxation imposed since the
war, which by this loan-cum-gift transaction of
100 million sterling threatens to become permanent,
has raised the prices of the necessaries
of life to an abnormal extent. The wages remain
virtually the same. Your Government which employs
large numbers of laboring men in railways,
canals, and otherwise have not considered it
necessary to raise the wages of the workingmen.
Will the private employer do otherwise? I know
from personal knowledge how frightfully the
poor Indian clerk is sweated in the offices of your
Government in India on a mere pittance. Can&#39;t
you feel for the millions of those little ones
whose already scanty, insufficient food is still
further reduced by the fresh taxes imposed by
your Government to find means to pay the war
budget and this permanent addition of £6,000,000
a year to their burden? Don&#39;t you know, sir,
that in India there are millions of widows (much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>[pg&nbsp;35]</span>
more than in any other country) who have to
support their little ones by their own toil and
that every penny of additional taxation hits them
hard. The hardships and privations imposed in
Europe by the war are nothing as compared with
what the Indian masses have been putting up
with, for the last fifty years or so. The fiscal
policy of your Government has ruined Indian
industry. You know it as well as anyone else.
Did you notice the letter of Mr. G. W. Forrest
in the London <i>Times</i> of March 14, 1917, wherein
he admitted that &quot;the tale of England&#39;s dealing
with Indian industry was one of littleness
and injustice,&quot; and that &quot;by positive prohibition
and heavy duties the Indian textile trade in
England was destroyed and our own trade was
fostered.&quot; You and your colleagues have used
grandiloquent rhetoric in your defense of the
increase in the cotton duties in India and over
your concern for India and Indian industries,
but you are mistaken if you think that anyone
in India is likely to be taken in by your hypocritical
professions. Pardon me, sir, I mean
no insult when I say &quot;hypocritical professions.&quot;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>[pg&nbsp;36]</span>
The practice is a part of a modern statesman&#39;s
job. He has to create a certain atmosphere before
he can make his people believe that what he
does is the only correct thing to do.</p>

<p class="indent">Your cotton duties, sir, afford no relief to the
Indian poor. It would not have hurt me much,
if you had forced or induced the Rajas and the
Maharajas, the bankers and the capitalists to
contribute even more than 100 million pounds to
the war expenses, as it is they who have grown
fat, if anyone in India has, under the British
regime, but to force the Indian ryot and the
Indian wage earner to do it and to continue to
pay for it for years to come out of his scanty
daily rations is the climax of cruelty. Then the
unkindest cut of all is that it should come from
you, whom we had associated with feelings of
kindness, and pity, for the poor and the workmen.</p>

<p class="indent">Your Government has called it a free and
spontaneous gift of the people of India! If the
members of your cabinet, if the Secretary of
State for India, if the Governor General of
India and his ministers of the Executive Council,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>[pg&nbsp;37]</span>
are the people of India, then truly you are right
and we wrong. If they are not the people of
India, as they are not, then it is a gift by yourself
to yourself, of other peoples&#39; money. Again,
the statement that the measure was unanimously
approved of by the Indian members of the council
is a <i>diplomatic lie</i>. You know that the matter
was settled between your Cabinet as represented
by the Secretary of State for India and the
Viceroy&#39;s Executive Council (which includes
only one Indian member nominated by you),
before it was announced in the Legislative
Council. You know also, sir, and if you don&#39;t,
you ought to, that the Indian Legislative Council
has no power under the law to make any changes
in the budget. The budget is entirely beyond
their purview. The members can only extol it
or criticise it. They can propose resolutions disapproving
of some of its provisions which can
amount to nothing more than pious wishes even
if passed. But the official majority in the Council
guarantees the defeat of any hostile resolutions
by non-official members. Re this loan-cum-gift
transaction, the non-official members of the Legislative
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>[pg&nbsp;38]</span>
Council put a seal on their mouths because
they thought it was useless to incur the risk of
being called disloyal for a matter which was reported
to them as a <i>fait accompli</i> and which they
could not in any way change or modify; yet two
of them did raise a sort of feeble protest.</p>

<p class="center">IT IS NOT A GIFT BY THE PEOPLE OF INDIA</p>

<p class="indent">The press comments on it, however subdued
and timid and halting, leave no doubt about the
real mind of India in the matter. The truth has
been pointed out by the <i>Manchester Guardian</i>
and the <i>Nation</i>. (Beg your pardon, sir, for
mentioning the <i>Nation</i> again). The former, in
its issue of March 15, remarked: &quot;It is we, who
govern India and not the Indian people. The
initiative in all financial proposals necessarily
comes from the government we appoint in India,
and these cannot reach the light of public discussion
in the Legislative Council or elsewhere
until they have received the sanction of the
Secretary of State for India here. For Mr.
Chamberlain to throw off upon Indian people
the responsibility for originating and devising
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>[pg&nbsp;39]</span>
the 100 million contribution is as unconvincing
a rhetorical exercise as the House of Commons
has witnessed for many a long day. The responsibility
from the first to the last is his and
that of the Indian Government. We have said
more than once, and we repeat it that in our
opinion a wise statesmanship would both find
better uses in India for India&#39;s millions and employ
India more advantageously for the common
cause by using more of her manhood and less of
her money,&quot; I will not quote the <i>Nation</i>, sir,
which is on this point as explicit, if not more,
as the <i>Manchester Guardian</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">Now, sir, you know that India has been very
eager to fight for the Empire. She has supplied
you with about 350,000 troops in this war, paying
for their services and equipment herself.
But 350,000 do not represent even a fraction of
her man power, the whole of which she was prepared
to throw in this struggle. While Australia
and Canada and Ireland have either rejected conscription
or are shirking, India has been clamoring
for it. You can no longer say that you
could not utilize India&#39;s manhood because of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>[pg&nbsp;40]</span>
prejudice of color. That shibboleth has been
shattered by this war and, we hope, for good.
The colored people of Asia and Africa are fighting
in numbers alongside of the best European
troops. Poor people! They believe they are
fighting to make the world &quot;safe for democracy!&quot;
You cannot say that Indians are lacking in fighting
qualities, because the existence of them in a
high degree they have proved conclusively in
face of difficulties, by no means light and contemptible.
That the Indian soldier can hold
his own in Europe, even better than the European
soldier in Southern Asia, has been established
beyond the shadow of a doubt by the
experiences of this war. Why, then, won&#39;t you
use India&#39;s manhood and relieve her of this
financial exaction which she can ill afford to
meet, without suffering egregiously?</p>

<p class="center">INDIA&#39;S TEEMING MILLIONS WANT FOOD AND<br />
KNOWLEDGE OF THREE R&#39;S</p>

<p class="indent">The question for India&#39;s teeming millions is
not &quot;how to live well&quot; but how to live at all.
There is no question of comforts for them. What
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>[pg&nbsp;41]</span>
they want, and do not get, is sufficient and
nourishing food and a knowledge of the three
R&#39;s. Your Government is unable to give them
the first, and persists in refusing to give them
the second; yet when an Indian publicist loses
patience and says &quot;slavery has deprived Indians
of wealth, honors and freedom, and has reduced
them to destitution and starvation,&quot; your Viceroy
in India cites it as an instance of depraved
journalism and a justification for the gagging
of the press. He complains that &quot;there are papers
in India which magnify the ills from which she
suffers&quot; and &quot;which harp upon plague, famine,
malaria and poverty&quot; and &quot;ascribe them all to the
curse of an alien government.&quot; May I ask, sir,
if it is not a fact that millions in India die of
famine, plague, and malaria? Is it not a fact
that the curses and the appalling effects of them,
are directly or indirectly traceable to poverty?
Many countries on the face of the earth do not
grow food sufficient for themselves while India
does. Why then should India alone suffer from
famines when her food supply, once in a while,
falls short of the ordinary year of agricultural
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>[pg&nbsp;42]</span>
&quot;prosperity?&quot; If even during famine years
India can supply food to other nations by exports
of wheat and other grains, why can&#39;t she keep
that food at home and feed her own hungry
children? Why should plague have stayed in
India so long? Why should malaria exact such
a heavy annual toll there? The reason is obvious.
Because of the ignorance and poverty of
the people.</p>

<p class="indent">Let us assume that India has not grown poorer
under British rule, though there is abundant
evidence to the contrary, that the masses have
become poorer and are becoming poorer every
day; let us also assume that in the matter of
education India was worse off under native rule&mdash;<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>,
before the introduction of the British rule&mdash;a
period of history when no other part of the
world was any the better. Is it not a matter of
shame, that after 150 years of British rule, when
most of the other national governments in other
parts of the world have reduced their illiteracy
almost to zero point, India should still have more
than 90% of its population illiterate. Is it not a
matter of shame, that of all the grain producing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>[pg&nbsp;43]</span>
countries of the world India alone should be so
miserably situated as to be unable to supply sufficient
and nourishing food to her sons and
daughters. Don&#39;t you think, sir, that the Indians
have reason to feel sore when they see that the
food grown by them is denied to them; that it
is almost snatched from their mouths; that others
should eat the food which is grown by them, that
even in the best of years millions of them must
be contented with only one meal a day, and that
of the coarsest grain.</p>

<p class="indent">Do you remember, Mr. Lloyd George, how
bitter you felt against the capitalist, when you
yourself in your boyhood, felt the pinch of want?
Have you forgotten all that you said in the Lime-house
speech? I repeat that the sufferings of
the British laborer and workingmen, the trials
of the British poor are nothing compared with
those of the Indian ryot and the Indian workingmen
and the Indian clerks in your employ in
that country. Yet you have no feeling to spare
for them, and those that have, you and your
Government brand as malcontents and seditionists.
Don&#39;t you think, sir, that the Indian ryot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>[pg&nbsp;44]</span>
and the Indian poor are being crushed under the
weight of two capitalisms superimposed upon
each other&mdash;one foreign and the other indigenous?
When we ask for freedom to manage
our own affairs you say we are not fit to do so.
But what can we do to ourselves which will be
worse than what you have done us? If left free,
we might bring to book the indigenous capitalists
whom, in the interests of your own capitalists,
you have been supporting and fattening. But
even if we fail to do so, we shall at any rate
have upon us the burden of only a single weight.
Your colleagues say that in refusing self-government
to India they are actuated by devotion
to India; that they do not want to hand over the
millions of India to the tender mercies of a small
minority of educated and wealthy men in whose
hands the government will inevitably drift. Supposing
it does, it will be easy for the masses to
keep the minority in check. They can revolt and
rebel, but under your Government the bureaucracy
is all powerful. The truth is, sir, that the condition
of these very millions, in whose interests,
you say, you are reluctant to give power to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45"></a>[pg&nbsp;45]</span>
educated and the wealthy few, is a standing condemnation
of your government there. The
educated minority and the wealthy few are fairly
well off under your regime. It is the ignorant
ryot and the millions of workingmen and women
who suffer. In the words of one of your distinguished
writers (W. Lily), they do not live
but just exist.</p>

<p class="indent">Recently the <i>Times</i> said that the British were
&quot;the trustees of the welfare of India&#39;s millions.&quot;
Who are these millions for whom you are trustees?
Are they those homeless, educationless
millions who get only one meal a day or are they
those who have benefitted from your schools and
are wealthy? If the former, you have failed in
your trust. If the latter, they are quite fit to
manage their own affairs. It was only the other
day that Mr. Austen Chamberlain was reported
to have said (<i>Times</i>, London, March 30) at a
luncheon given to him and the India&#39;s so-called
representatives at the Imperial conference (one
of whom was a Lieutenant Governor interested
in extending India&#39;s sphere of subjection) that
&quot;India will not remain and ought not to remain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>[pg&nbsp;46]</span>
content to be a hewer of wood and a drawer of
water for the rest of the Empire.&quot; Noble words
these, full of hope and encouragement. But
what a sad and a crushing acknowledgment of
the present helpless condition of India. It is a
truthful statement for which the Indians ought
to be grateful to Mr. Chamberlain. At the
present moment India is a mere &quot;hewer of wood
and a drawer of water&quot; for the rest of the Empire.
Against that her sons protest, and will
continue to protest, as long as the wrongs of the
country are not redressed, your press act, your
sedition laws, jails and prisons notwithstanding.</p>

<p class="indent">The position, Mr. Lloyd George, is pathetic.
When we ask for more outlay on education, you
say, no, the condition of the finances will not permit
of that. When we point out the way to find
finances, you say, &quot;no, further taxes are impossible
and retrenchment in public expenditure in
other departments undesirable.&quot; When we say,
&quot;give us the management and we will do it,&quot; you
say, &quot;no you are unfit.&quot; The result is that you
will neither educate the masses yourself nor will
you let us educate them. Yet you hold their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>[pg&nbsp;47]</span>
ignorance a valid ground for refusing us our right
to manage our own affairs. When, however, you
want money for Imperial purposes you raise loans,
impose taxes, and reduce public expenditure on
education and public works. You have done this
not only now, for the purposes of this bloody
war, but you have done so in the past in building
railways for your merchants and to fight your
wars in Africa, in China, in Afghanistan, in fact,
all over the old world. It is true the present is
a trying time for you and you may have a pretence
of justification in this crisis in your Imperial
life. But so long as you refuse the conscription
of wealth in your home islands, what
right have you to impose this conscription of
India&#39;s money resources? You have not forced
the dominions to make monetary contributions.
In fact you have advanced them over £140,000,000
from your own funds. You have not so far
called upon the British capitalists to pay even a
fraction of their wealth. You have simply taxed
their excessive profits. Why should you have
made an exception in the case of India? India
is the poorest part of the Empire. Yet it is she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>[pg&nbsp;48]</span>
who has been selected for this exceptional treatment.
She had already made lavish gifts of
money and provisions and equipment. Her gifts
were in entire disproportion to her means. Compared
with your dominions&#39; resources and their
money sacrifices India&#39;s contribution stood higher
than those of the former. Yet you selected India
for this compulsory money contribution because
India is the only part of the Empire which you
could thus treat. India is the only part of the
Empire which has been forced to give $500,000,000
as a <i>free gift</i>. Even the fabulously rich
United States which have made huge war profits
from you and your other allies have not thought
of a national gift. Yet imperial sophistry represented
by your imperial publicists and officials,
represents that Great Britain exacts no tribute
from India and makes no profit out of her connection
with India and that she rules India simply
out of philanthropic and humanitarian motives.</p>

<p class="center">WASTE</p>

<p class="indent">One would have thought that under the pressure
of the war, your Government in India would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>[pg&nbsp;49]</span>
make an honest and earnest effort to reduce expenditure
on public services, at least under heads
mainly ornamental or which only afford luxuries
to your agents in India; but on the other hand,
what is the actual situation? A perusal of the
proceedings of the Imperial Legislative Council
and also of the Provincial Councils shows that
all efforts made by the non-official members to
obtain additional money for education and sanitation
by the reduction of expenditure on luxuries,
were opposed by your Government, and were
consequently defeated. All efforts to reduce
expenditure on comforts were of course resisted
by those who enjoyed them, and it is they whose
votes count in the Indian Councils. For example,
it was proposed that the huge expenditure incurred
by the different Government Departments,
Imperial and Provincial, in moving to the Hills
for seven months of the year, should be reduced,
at least partially. Many persons competent to
express an opinion on the subject, among them
Lord Carmichael, the retiring Governor of Bengal,
have placed it on record that this &quot;exodus to
the hills&quot; was not necessary, and was in fact
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>[pg&nbsp;50]</span>
prejudicial to the interests of good government;
yet the Government opposed the motion of the
non-official member and he was forced to withdraw
it. A similar motion to curtail the expenditure
on the ornamentation of the residence
of the Lieutenant Governor of the United Provinces
was also opposed and met a similar fate.
The huge allowances made to the heads of the
different governments in India for kitchen expenses,
for dispensing hospitality, and for traveling
in royal style have not been reduced by a
penny. The Punjab Government has provided
in its current budget a large amount of money
for providing palatial residences for its officers
in summer resorts, and has sanctioned large pensions,
from father to son, for a few of their
Indian supporters. These men are mostly
wealthy men. They did nothing more than
help you in your suppressive and exploiting
policy. Your Government naturally rewards
them. Is it not bribery. If an expert financier
were to examine into these items, which can
only pass unchallenged in a country wherein
the people have no voice in the raising of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>[pg&nbsp;51]</span>
taxes and in spending them, it would be found
that great savings could be effected and the
money thus made available used for other urgent
needs of the people. The fact is that the Indian
ryot who pays for all these extravagances has
no voice to check the vagaries of those who
spend his money for their own comforts. I have
not mentioned the lavish scale on which special
traveling allowances are granted to high officials
in India. It is a matter of common knowledge
that these officials do not spend as much as they
draw under this head. Yet it is actually proposed
that the salaries and the allowances for
the European members of the Indian services be
substantially raised. <i>Verily, taxation without
representation</i> is a crime of the worst possible
kind.</p>

<p class="center">DEMOCRACY</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Lloyd George, you and your colleagues in
the Government of Great Britain, say that in
fighting the Germans you are fighting the battle
of Democracy, to make the world safe from
autocracy and militarism, that you are fighting
for rights of small nations, and for the domination
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>[pg&nbsp;52]</span>
of right over might. The United States
has joined the war for the same reason. I have
seen numerous recruiting posters exhibited in
New York City exhorting young Americans to
enlist in the army &quot;to make the world safe&quot; for
Democracy. I have not the slightest doubt of
the sincerity of the American professions because
their international record is so far clean. Vide
their record in Cuba and the Philippines. Can
we say the same for Great Britain? I am afraid
not, so long at least, as you continue to deny
self-government to India, the second of the two
biggest democracies of the world. Here is a
nation of 315 million human beings (or say
several nations, if you wish, as your publicists
are so fond of repeating <i>ad nauseam</i> that India
is not a nation) whom you are governing by the
force of might, without their consent, and on
absolutely despotic lines; whom you deny freedom
of speech, freedom of association and freedom
of education; whom you tax without their consent
and then spend those taxes outside of their
country, and in providing luxuries to your representatives
in India or in bribing such Indians as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id="page53"></a>[pg&nbsp;53]</span>
uphold you in your possessions. I have no doubt
that you are sincere in your denunciation of
German militarism. For myself I have no use
for Czars and Kaisers, Emperors and Sultans,
and I dare say that you, too, have none. Thus
I am in full sympathy with your efforts to exterminate
the race of Kaisers. So far you are
right. But an Indian cannot help smiling rather
cynically when he hears you saying that you are
waging the war to make the world safe for
democracy. Your conduct in India and in Egypt,
and in Persia belies your protestations.</p>

<p class="center">AS TO SMALL NATIONS</p>

<p class="indent">In defending your conduct you urge that India
is not a nation. Very well, sir, divide India into
small nations and give them self-government
separately. You will admit that there are parts
of India which are homogenous, entitled to
be called small nations in the sense in which
Belgium, Switzerland, Denmark, and Holland
are. The bulk of the population follow the same
religion, speak the same language and belong to
the same race. Remember, please, that I do not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>[pg&nbsp;54]</span>
admit that India is not a nation or that the sameness
of language, religion and race is necessary
for a political national existence. Switzerland,
Canada, the United States, South Africa, Russia,
and Austria-Hungary have demolished that
theory.</p>

<p class="indent">The apologists of the present system of Government
in India say that the Indian people are
not sufficiently educated in the principles and
practice of politics and that their ignorance and
illiteracy make it necessary for the British to
continue to rule them from without, until they
are fit to establish and maintain a democratic
form of government. I have already made some
remarks about illiteracy and shown that the responsibility
for it rests on your shoulders. If you,
sir, are to be the sole judge of the educational
requirements of the Indian people, their progress
is bound to hang on your convenience. No one
in possession is anxious to be dispossessed and
if the time and method of his dispossession is to
be determined by himself, then woe to the dispossessed!
But, sir, you forget that literacy is
not education. The Indian masses have a background
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>[pg&nbsp;55]</span>
of centuries of culture which places them
in the matter of intelligence and character, in a
better position than even the literate millions of
European and American countries. And after
all, it is intelligence and culture that count most
in the fixing of final values.</p>

<p class="indent">As for their training in political life, how are
they to get it, if you make it a penal offence for
their leaders to tell them that the present system
of Government is unnatural, harmful, and a
hindrance to progress? The masses cannot
grasp principles unless one illustrates these principles
by their application to the affairs of every
day life. Your Government and your courts say
that an agitation for home rule is legal and permissible,
but any criticism that is likely to create
dissatisfaction is illegal and deserves to be suppressed
high-handedly. You know from experience,
sir, that the masses require to be led.
No government is willing to make changes unless
compelled from below. That is as true of
democratic America as of monarchical England.
Much more must it be so in the case of countries
under foreign yoke. To carry the people with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>[pg&nbsp;56]</span>
them, the leaders must expose the existing evils
and stress the necessity and urgency of sweeping
changes in political conditions. The moment
they proceed to do so with any degree of effectiveness,
they are charged with an attempt to
create disaffection and convicted of sedition. Do
you honestly believe that any people on the face
of the earth can make any progress in political
education when they are ruled by a Press Act
which stops criticism and discussion in the following
terms:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="center">
SECTION OF THE INDIAN PRESS ACT OF 1910</p>

<p class="indent">Whenever it appears to the Local Government that
any printing press in respect of which any security
has been deposited as required by Section 3 is used
for the purpose of printing or publishing any newspaper,
book, or other document containing any words,
signs or visible representations which are likely to
have a tendency directly, or indirectly, whether by
inference, suggestion, allusion, metaphor, implication
or otherwise:</p>

<p class="indent">(a) To incite to murder or to any offense under the
Explosives Substances Act of 1908, or to any act of
violence or</p>

<p class="indent">(b) To seduce any officer, soldier, or sailor in the

his duty or</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>[pg&nbsp;57]</span></p>

<p class="indent">
(c) To bring into hatred or contempt His Majesty
or the Government established by the law in British
India, or the Administration of Justice in British India
or any native Prince or Chief under the suzeranity of
His Majesty or any class or section of His Majesty&#39;s
subjects in British India or to excite disaffection
towards His Majesty or the said Government or any
such Prince or Chief or</p>

<p class="indent">(d) To put any person in fear or to cause any annoyance
to him and thereby induce him to deliver to
any person any property or valuable security, or to
do any act which he is not legally bound to do or to
omit any act which he is legally entitled to do or</p>

<p class="indent">(e) To encourage or incite any person to interfere
with the administration of the law or with the maintenance
of law and order or</p>

<p class="indent">(f) To convey any threat of injury to a public
servant, or to any person in whom the public servant
is believed to be interested, with a view to inducing that
person to do any act or to forbear to do any act connected
with the exercise of his public functions the
Local Government may, by notice in writing to the
keeper of such printing press, stating or describing the
words, signs or visible representations which in its
opinion are of the nature described above, declare the
security deposited in respect of such Press and all
copies of such newspaper, book, or other document
wherever found to be forfeited to His Majesty.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Explanation I</span>: In clause c the expression disaffection
includes disloyalty and all feelings of enmity.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Explanation II</span>: Comments expressing the disapproval

or other action of the Government or any
such native Prince or Chief or of the administration

to excite hatred, contempt, or disaffection, do not
come under the scope of clause c.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Can any people make headway in the art of
self-government who are governed by a foreign
bureaucracy aided by an army of Indian Czars
regulating the very minutest details of their life?
You know that this over government of India
is a direct result of your rule. Before you came
the Indian village was a self-governed unit.
(See statements of Monroe, Elphinstone, Metcalfe,
and Lawrence.) Even now the people in
the Native States are in this respect better off
than the people of British India. The Education
Minister of your Cabinet, Mr. H. A. L. Fisher
has, after a visit to India, placed it on record
that &quot;the inhabitants of a well governed Native
State are, on the whole, happier and more contented
than the inhabitants of British India.
They are more lightly taxed; the pace of the
administration is less urgent and exacting. They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>[pg&nbsp;59]</span>
feel that they do things for themselves instead
of having everything done by a cold and alien
benevolence.&quot; Yet if an Indian leader were to
point this out and ask the Indian masses to improve
their lot by demanding and winning for
themselves the right to manage their own affairs,
and by driving out those influences that stand in
their way, he would be persecuted and imprisoned
or transported.</p>

<p class="indent">The first axiom for political progress is that
the people should throw away their attitude of
submission to oppression, tyranny, high-handedness,
and conditions of slavery whether imposed
by a national or a foreign Government. They
have a right to revolt if they have the means to
do so successfully. But in any case, they have
a right to discuss, agitate and organize for
changes. This they cannot do unless they have a
free press, a free platform, and the right of free
association. In India the first is denied by the
Press Act, the second by the comprehensive sections
of the Penal Code, and the third by the so-called
&quot;Seditious Meetings Act.&quot; What little was
left has been done away with under the extensive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>[pg&nbsp;60]</span>
powers taken and exercised by the Executive
under the plea of war exigency by the &quot;Defense
of India Act.&quot; While every other part of the
Empire, including the &quot;Mother Country&quot; is discussing
political and economic changes of an
extremely radical character, such as the establishment
of a more effective Imperial Parliament
and Preferential Tariffs after the war, not to
speak of constructive programmes for education,
and industrial rejuvenation, the Indian leaders are
&quot;officially&quot; advised to be mum, and any effort to
rouse the country to a consciousness of its rights
and duties is characterized as perverted, ill-timed,
and inconsistent with loyalty.</p>

<p class="indent">The advocates of &quot;Home Rule&quot; are being
openly hampered in their propaganda. Papers
advocating home rule have been persecuted, and
leaders have been prohibited from entering provincial
areas. But what is worse is that the
Criminal Investigation Department have been instructed
to take down the names of all those who
have enlisted in the cause, either as active or
passive workers. A deputation of representatives
of the press that waited on the Viceroy to lay
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id="page61"></a>[pg&nbsp;61]</span>
their grievances before him has been lectured on
the impropriety of thus raising the question at
this juncture and has otherwise been treated with
shocking discourtesy.</p>

<p class="indent">In conclusion, let me ask you, sir, to notice the
coercive methods by which the War Loan is
being raised in India. Poor underpaid subordinate
officials are being forced to purchase Government
stock. They will surely purchase the stock
and win the good-will of their officers, but just
as surely they will squeeze the cost out of the
people. That will be strictly in accord with the
standards of loyalty set up by your officials!</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. David Lloyd George, I have addressed
this letter to you, because at this moment you
seem to be the only British statesman possessed
of imagination. Exercise your imagination, sir,
a little and save India for the Empire; win the
gratitude and blessings of a fifth of the human
race&mdash;of a people who were one of the first
pioneers of civilization in the world, who laid
the foundations of culture, which you profess to
be so very anxious to save. Remember that the
Indians were rich, prosperous, free, self-governing,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>[pg&nbsp;62]</span>
civilized and great, both in peace and war,
when not only Britain but even &quot;Greece and
Rome were nursing the tenants of the wilderness.&quot;
The Indians have lost their freedom
because they oppressed the people under them
and as surely as night follows day, the British
will lose all that makes them great to-day, if
they continue to oppress and exploit the subject
races within their Empire. The world cannot
be safe for democracy unless India is self-governed.
Nor can there be any lasting peace in the
world, so long as India and China are not strong
enough to protect themselves.</p>

<p class="indent">Pardon me, sir, if I have disturbed you at
such a critical moment; though it is folly to presume
that you could be disturbed in the slightest
degree by such a letter. I have written it out
of a sense of duty as sacred as that which inspires
you in your herculean task; and if you
are inclined to think harshly of me for this letter,
just try to put yourself in my position and decide
what then would be your point of view.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
